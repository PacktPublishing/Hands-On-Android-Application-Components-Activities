## About the Video Course
It is important for Android developers to understand activity behavior when the user leaves and re-enters an application to avoid crashing, losing the user's progress, and consuming valuable system resources.

With this course, you will enhance your application development skills and develop efficient, seamless, and fault-tolerant applications without crashing or losing data while performing any other task.

In this course, you will begin by building the core of your applications with the activity class. You will create and modify activities to build effective Android applications. You will also learn how an activity interacts with the rest of the Android operating system.

By the end of the course, you will have developed a strong foundation and confidence to implement core Android activities in order to launch, deploy, and communicate between activities while building Android applications.

Please note that basic working knowledge of Android programming and Kotlin are required for taking this course.
